                        Indo Evergreenâ€™s highland vegetable farm and cooperatives provide natural, organic, and pesticide-free produce that is grown in a traditional cultivation methods along with a greenhouse hydroponic cultivation system. Hydroponic systems eliminate the need for toxic pesticides, and allows IEG to grow their crops in a clean mountain environment that is distant enough from industrial pollution, but close enough to be local and environmentally sustainable. As a result, fresh salad greens and herbs like Italian basil and coriander that are straight from the farm to your door, with no middleman, can be enjoyed. Plus, IEG possesses its own cold chain logistics so you can be sure your produce stays fresh all the way from farm to table. From the farmer to our stringent quality control, then to you.
